## Processs
-Gather Data: Collect relevant insurance data (e.g., policies, claims, customer demographics) and ensure it’s in a usable format like .csv or a database.

-Load Data into Power BI: Import the data (e.g., insurance_data.csv) into Power BI Desktop.

-Clean and Transform Data: Use Power Query to clean the dataset by removing duplicates, filling missing values, and reformatting columns as needed.

-Create Relationships: If working with multiple tables, establish relationships between them based on common fields like Policy ID or Customer ID.

-Define Metrics: Create calculated columns and measures (e.g., Total Claims, Average Payout, Retention Rate) to capture key performance indicators.

-Design Visualizations: Add visuals like:

  Bar charts for claims by region.
  Pie charts for policy distribution.
  Line charts for premium trends.
  KPI cards for high-level metrics.
  Add Filters and Slicers: Enable interactivity by adding slicers for filtering by date, region, policy type, etc.

-Format and Style: Apply a professional theme, consistent colors, and proper labeling for clarity and ease of use.

-Test the Dashboard: Validate the data, test slicer functionality, and ensure accurate calculations.

-Publish and Share: Save the .pbix file, publish it to the Power BI Service, and share it with stakeholders by providing access or generating a shareable link.
